## What Do Customers Want?
- Have you ever felt frustrated at the way a company has handled a your reasonable request?  Like your cable company.  It's happend to all of us.  Why do companies make the customer experience so bad.  As companies grows, customer obession often wanes.
- Your customers are interested in what's good for them, not what easisest or best for you.  THey have business challengs and they want you to help solve them.  Not interested in what's going on behind the scenes.   THey experience your brand in personal moments and interactions.  Only a few touch points in a day or week or month that drives their perception to your brand and the emotional connection they make with your brand.
- You need to learn to think like a customer in all parts of the journey with you.  From the moment they sign the contract.  Use this knowledge to drive how you optimize the customer experience.
- Remember your customers are probably very different from you.
- Don't make decisions base on your point of view or refence

### Avoid inside-out thinking.

#### Henry Ford Analogy
- Ignore what customers wanted and create something different.  Don't use this analogy when working with customers.  Listen to your customers.  Customers often know the market better you than you do.

#### Prospect Preference
- Customer won't sign a deal because product doesn't do something the customer wants.  THe product bumps current requests to add features the prospect wants to close the current deal.  The product team should prioritize what customers want/need to make product better/stronger rather one or two prospects

#### Shiny thing syndrome
- MVP get new features into customers hands early.  Valid theory.  MVP is minimum feature that the customer wants and the product team focuses on next shiny thing.

Bain & Company - "80% of senior managers think their organization are customer-focused.  Only 8% of their customers agreed."  To be customer focused requires commitment, investment and focus.  

  
## Channeling Your Customers
- To channel the customer it requires effort to think like your customer.  Put yourself in your customer's shoes
- The solution isn't a process - it's a change of mindset.  It change in habit and that's tough change.  Take small practical steps that you repeat ofte enough
- A helpful first is to introduce your customers "virtually" into decision you are making internally.  Ask those considering the change "What would our customers think of this new change feature, process change or product? Would customer like this?"  "How does this impact our customers?" "Is there a way to do this that would be better for our customers?"
  

## Raising Awareness
- Challenge your colleagues to think differently.  We are developing products and services for customers not ourselves
- Invite colleagues from other departments and roles to join when you go on-site with customers. Engineer, developers, product management team.  Let them see the product being used by the customer
- Invite a customer into the office for "lunch and learn" and buy pizza for everyone that shows up.  Meet the real people you are building product for.  Let the customer talk about what they like about your product, how they use your product, and what may be frustrating about your product
- Invite a customer to share their store at your next all-hands meeting.  Dedicate 5~10 minutes to a customer share an update for their business and what we've done to help them and what they would like to see in the product
- Share news about your customers' business success on internal channels.
- Create a slack channel in which you share ad-hoc feedback (good and bad) that you recieve from customers.  Fine ways to share that information frictionless.  
- Challenge teammates to spend time helping out in customer-facing roles.  Get CEOs, finance teams, developers and put them in the 1st line support role for a day.  This will give them great feedback from customers undiluted unfiltered directly from the customer.  They will learn that being on 1st level support is a hard job to do day-to-day.
- Buy or use your customers' products and services.  Try to use customers' products and services to see what their business is like.  Encourage your employees to know about your customers.

Whatever techniques you choose to raise aweareness make them a habit and not a fad.  Do it consistnently.  Share the learnings and stories you learn from you customer with your colleagues.
