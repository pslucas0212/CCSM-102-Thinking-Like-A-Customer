## What Do Customers Want?
- Have you ever felt frustrated at the way a company has handled a your reasonable request?  Like your cable company.  It's happend to all of us.  Why do companies make the customer experience so bad.  As companies grows, customer obession often wanes.
- Your customers are interested in what's good for them, not what easisest or best for you.  THey have business challengs and they want you to help solve them.  Not interested in what's going on behind the scenes.   THey experience your brand in personal moments and interactions.  Only a few touch points in a day or week or month that drives their perception to your brand and the emotional connection they make with your brand.
- You need to learn to think like a customer in all parts of the journey with you.  From the moment they sign the contract.  Use this knowledge to drive how you optimize the customer experience.
- Remember your customers are probably very different from you.
- Don't make decisions base on your point of view or refence

### Avoid inside-out thinking.

#### Henry Ford Analogy
- Ignore what customers wanted and create something different.  Don't use this analogy when working with customers.  Listen to your customers.  Customers often know the market better you than you do.

#### Prospect Preference
- Customer won't sign a deal because product doesn't do something the customer wants.  THe product bumps current requests to add features the prospect wants to close the current deal.  The product team should prioritize what customers want/need to make product better/stronger rather one or two prospects

#### Shiny thing syndrome
- MVP get new features into customers hands early.  Valid theory.  MVP is minimum feature that the customer wants and the product team focuses on next shiny thing.

Bain & Company - "80% of senior managers think their organization are customer-focused.  Only 8% of their customers agreed."  To be customer focused requires commitment, investment and focus.
